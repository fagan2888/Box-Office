# Box-Office
Cohort 12 Capstone Project for the Certificate of Data Science at Georgetown University School of Continuing Studies. 

# Project Topic
Our team will try to predict movie box office returns by using the different attributes of movies.  Attributes may include the movie's cast, genre, plot, reviews, rating, budget, length, among others.

# Available Data Sources
Several movie data sets exist, each possibly with their own unique set of attributes for each movie. Formatted data sets are available on Kaggle and in some movie APIs, while other unformatted data is available on certain websites.

# Approach
Our team will attempt to consolidate all the data we can find into one merged table.  We may need to limit the number of attributes we analyze in order to get as large a dataset as possible. We also may need to explore ways to fill in missing data. Once the data is consolidated and cleaned, we plan on using regressions, classification models, and other machine learning algorithms to find which models and which set of attributes best predict box office returns.
